## 👋 My Story

I’m **Ekezie Uzochukwu Richmond (Juju)** — a backend-focused engineer with a strong foundation in **data engineering**, driven by curiosity for how systems scale, fail, and recover in real-world environments.

My journey into software engineering started with a desire to move beyond writing code that “works” into building systems that are **reliable, observable, and data-informed**. With a background in mechanical engineering and hands-on experience across backend development and data pipelines, I naturally gravitated toward designing services that sit at the intersection of **APIs, databases, and data infrastructure**.

Over time, I’ve worked on projects ranging from **transaction-heavy bookkeeping systems** to **data ingestion pipelines**, where performance, correctness, and maintainability matter. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, modeling real-world processes into clean data structures, and turning vague requirements into production-ready solutions.

Today, I focus on building **scalable backend systems**, **data-driven platforms**, and **clean service architectures**, while continuously sharpening my skills in distributed systems, cloud-native tooling, and modern data stacks.
